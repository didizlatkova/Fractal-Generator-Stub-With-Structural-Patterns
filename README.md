# Fractal-Generator-Stub-With-Structural-Patterns
We need to create a system which server could be configured remotely. We could set specific combination of configurations from the remote client and this combinations are handled on the server runtime. 

Unfortunately we have a requirement to use legacy company module for configurations on the server side  and this module is relying on old third party library version. As always happened there is new version of the third party library and we want to fit it to our module which depends on the old version. (Please think about third party interfaces and mapping to the legacy module. How this configuration module could be used in different combination of parameters)
